DOMAIN: DATA SCIENCE

DURATION:4 WEEKS

MENTOR:NEELA SANTOSH

DESCRIPITON OF THE TASK:As part of my internship with CodTech, I completed Task 2, which involved developing an image classification model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The goal was to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset into one of 10 object categories such as airplanes, cars, cats, dogs, and ships.

This project introduced me to the core concepts of deep learning and CNN architecture, providing hands-on experience with model building, training, evaluation, and result visualization.

Training Accuracy: ~80%

Test Accuracy: ~72%

Loss decreased steadily over epochs
